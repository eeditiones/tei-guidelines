Schemas can be generated in each of XML DTD\n      language, W3C schema language, and RELAX NG schema language. Documentation can be generated in\n      a variety of commonly-used document formats, including HTML, DOCX, or PDF.\n      </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.14.9\">TEI components are freely available over the Internet and elsewhere.

For this reason, the TEI schema\n      supports a variety of different approaches to solving similar problems, and also defines a\n      much richer set of elements than is likely to be necessary in any given project. Furthermore,\n      the TEI schema may be extended in well-defined and documented ways for texts that cannot be\n      conveniently or appropriately encoded using what is provided. For these reasons, it is almost\n      impossible to use the TEI schema without customizing it in some way. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.8\">This section describes how the TEI encoding schema may be customized, and should be read in\n      conjunction with chapter <pb-link class=\"inner-ref\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.8.2\" emit=\"transcription\" hash=\"TD\" xml-id=\"TD\">22 Documentation Elements</pb-link>, which describes how a specific application of\n      the TEI encoding schema should be documented. The documentation system described in that\n      chapter is, like the rest of the TEI schema, independent of any particular schema or document\n      type definition language. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.10\">Formally speaking, these Guidelines provide both syntactic rules about how elements and\n      attributes may be used in valid documents and semantic recommendations about what\n      interpretation should be attached to a given syntactic construct. In this sense, they provide\n      both a <span class=\"tei-term\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.10.2\">document type definition</span> and a <span class=\"tei-term\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.10.4\">document type declaration</span>.\n      More exactly, we may distinguish between the <span class=\"tei-term\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.10.6\">TEI Abstract Model</span>, which defines a\n      set of related concepts, and the <span class=\"tei-term\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.10.8\">TEI schema</span> which defines a set of syntactic\n      rules and constraints. Many (though not all) of the semantic recommendations are provided\n      solely as informal descriptive prose, though some of them are also enforced by means of such\n      constructs as datatypes (see <pb-link class=\"inner-ref\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.10.10\" emit=\"transcription\" hash=\"DTYPES\" xml-id=\"DTYPES\">1.4.2 Datatype Specifications</pb-link>), or by schema constraints expressed\n      using the Schematron language. Schematron constraints provide information about special kinds\n      of validation errors dependent on conditional relationships, such as the invalidity of an\n      attribute name or value on one element when another is present, or when, given a pair of\n      attributes such as minOccurs and maxOccurs, the minimum value exceeds\n      the maximum value. Schematron constraints also provide warnings when a particular element,\n      attribute, or combination is to be deprecated in future releases of the TEI scheme, to alert\n      users that the feature in question is no longer to be used after a certain date. Very rarely,\n      TEI Schematron constraints offer warnings that do not explicitly break with the TEI but\n      suggest a more efficient or less ambiguous encoding.\n      \n      Although the descriptions, validation errors, and warnings have been written with care, there\n      will inevitably be cases where the intention of the contributors has not been conveyed with\n      sufficient clarity to prevent users of these Guidelines from extending\n      them in the sense of attaching slightly variant semantics to them. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.12\">Beyond this unintentional semantic extension, some of the elements described can\n      intentionally be used in a variety of ways; for example, the element <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.12.2\" href=\"/ref/note\" target=\"\">note</a> has an\n      attribute type which can take on arbitrary string values, depending on how it is\n      used in a document. A new type of <span class=\"tei-q2\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.12.6\">note</span>, therefore, requires no change in the existing\n      model. On the other hand, for many applications, it may be desirable to constrain the possible\n      values for the type attribute to a small set of possibilities. A schema modified in\n      this way would no longer necessarily regard as valid the same set of documents as the\n      corresponding unmodified TEI schema, but would remain faithful to the same conceptual\n      model.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.14\">This section explains how the TEI schema can be customized by suppressing elements, modifying\n      classes of elements, or adding elements. Documents which\n      validate against an application of the TEI schema which has been customized in this way may or\n      may not be considered TEI-conformant, as further discussed in section\n        <pb-link class=\"inner-ref\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.14.6\" emit=\"transcription\" hash=\"CF\" xml-id=\"CF\">23.4 Conformance</pb-link>.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.16\">The TEI system is designed to support modification and customization in a documented way that\n      can be validated by an XML processor. This is achieved by writing a small TEI-conformant\n      document, known informally as an ODD (One Document Does it all), from which an appropriate\n      processor can generate both human-readable documentation, and a schema expressed in a language\n      such as RELAX NG or DTD. The mechanisms used to instantiate a TEI schema differ for different\n      schema languages, and are therefore not defined here. In XML DTDs, for example, extensive use\n      is made of parameter entities, while in RELAX NG schemas, extensive use is made of patterns.\n      In either case, the names of elements and, wherever possible, their attributes and content\n      models are defined indirectly. The syntax used to implement this indirection also varies with\n      the schema language used, but the underlying constructs in the TEI Abstract Model are given\n      the same names.\n      \n      This indirection makes it simpler to implement customization of the TEI system in an\n      accessible and human-readable way. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.18\">As further discussed in section <pb-link class=\"inner-ref\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.18.2\" emit=\"transcription\" hash=\"ST\" xml-id=\"ST\">1 The TEI Infrastructure</pb-link>, the TEI encoding schema comprises a set\n      of class and macro declarations, and a number of <span class=\"tei-term\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.18.4\">modules</span>. Each module is made up\n      of element and attribute declarations, and a schema is made by combining a particular set of\n      modules together. In the absence of any other kind of customization, when modules are combined\n      together: <ol class=\"tei-list1 numbered\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.18.6\">\n<li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.18.6.3\">all the elements defined by the module (and described in the corresponding section of\n          these Guidelines) are included in the schema;</li>\n<li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.18.6.5\">each such element is identified by the canonical name given it in these\n          Guidelines;</li>\n<li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.18.6.7\">the content model of each such element is as defined by these Guidelines;</li>\n<li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.18.6.9\">the names, datatypes, and permitted values declared for each attribute associated with\n          each such element are as given in these Guidelines;</li>\n<li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.18.6.11\">the elements comprising element classes and the meaning of macro declarations\n          expressed in terms of element classes is determined by the particular combination of\n          modules selected.</li>\n</ol> The TEI customization mechanisms allow the user to control this behaviour as follows:\n        <ol class=\"tei-list1 numbered\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.18.8\">\n<li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.18.8.3\">particular elements may be suppressed, removing them from any classes in which they\n          are members, and also from any generated schema; </li>\n<li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.18.8.5\">new elements may be added to an existing class, thus making them available in macros\n          or content models defined in terms of those classes;</li>\n<li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.18.8.7\">additional attributes, or attribute values, may be specified for an individual element\n          or for classes of elements; </li>\n<li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.18.8.9\">within certain limits, attributes, or attribute values, may also be removed either\n          from an individual element or for classes of elements; </li>\n<li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.18.8.11\">the characteristics inherited by one class from another class may be modified by\n          modifying its class membership: all members of the class then inherit the changed\n          characteristics;</li>\n<li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.18.8.13\">the set of values legal for an attribute or attribute class may be constrained or\n          relaxed by supplying or modifying a value list, or by modifying its datatype.</li>\n<li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.18.8.15\">within certain limits, the name (generic identifier) associated with an element may be\n          changed, without changing the semantic or syntactic properties of the element;</li>\n</ol> The modification mechanisms presented in this section are quite general, and may be\n      used to make all the types of changes just listed. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.20\">The recommended way of implementing and documenting all such modifications is by means of the\n      ODD system described in chapter <pb-link class=\"inner-ref\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.20.2\" emit=\"transcription\" hash=\"TD\" xml-id=\"TD\">22 Documentation Elements</pb-link>; in the remainder of this section we give\n      specific examples to illustrate how that system may be applied. An ODD processor, such as the\n      Roma application supported by the TEI, or any other comparable set of stylesheets will use the\n      declarations provided by an ODD to generate appropriate sets of declarations in a specific\n      schema language such as RELAX NG or the XML DTD language. We do not discuss in detail here how\n      this should be done, since the details are schema language-specific; some background\n      information about the methods used for XML DTD and RELAX NG schema generation is however\n      provided in section <pb-link class=\"inner-ref\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.20.4\" emit=\"transcription\" hash=\"STIN\" xml-id=\"STIN\">1.2 Defining a TEI Schema</pb-link>. Several example ODD files are also provided as part\n      of the standard TEI release: see further section <pb-link class=\"inner-ref\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.20.6\" emit=\"transcription\" hash=\"MDlite\" xml-id=\"MDlite\">23.3.4 Examples of Modification </pb-link> below.</p>\n<div class=\"tei-div10\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22\" id=\"MDMD\">\n<h3 class=\"tei-head9\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.4\">23.3.1 Kinds of Modification</h3>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.6\">For ease of discussion, we distinguish the following different kinds of modification: <ol class=\"tei-list1 numbered\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.6.2\">\n<li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.6.2.3\">deletion of elements;</li>\n<li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.6.2.5\">modification of content models;</li>\n<li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.6.2.7\">modification of attribute and attribute-value lists;</li>\n<li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.6.2.9\">modification of class membership;</li>\n<li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.6.2.11\">addition of new elements.</li>\n<li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.6.2.13\">renaming of elements;</li>\n</ol> Each of these is described in the following sections.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.8\">Each kind of modification changes the set of documents that will be considered valid\n        according to the resulting schema. A schema derived from any combination of unmodified TEI\n        declarations (an \"unmodified schema\") may be thought of as defining a certain set of\n        documents. A schema deriving from a combination of modified TEI declarations (a \"modified\n        schema\") will define a different set of documents. The set of documents valid according to\n        the modified schema may or may not be properly contained by the set of documents considered\n        to be valid according to the unmodified schema. The schema <span class=\"tei-ident3 ident\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.8.2\">TEI-All</span> is the\n        special case of the unmodified schema which includes all currently available TEI modules. We\n        use the term <span class=\"tei-term\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.8.4\">clean modification</span> for cases where the set of documents defined by a\n        modified schema is a proper subset of the set of documents defined by TEI-All. Where this is\n        not the case, that is, where the modified schema considers valid some documents which\n        TEI-All does not, we use the term <span class=\"tei-term\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.8.6\">unclean modification</span>. Despite this\n        terminology, unclean modifications are not particularly deprecated, and their use may often\n        be vital to the success of a project. The concept is introduced solely to distinguish the\n        effects of different kinds of modification.</p>\n<div class=\"tei-div10\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.12\" id=\"MDMDSU\">\n<h4 class=\"tei-head9\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.12.4\">23.3.1.1 Deletion of Elements</h4>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.12.6\">The simplest way to modify the supplied modules is to suppress one or more of the\n          supplied elements. This is simply done by setting the mode attribute to\n            delete on an <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.12.6.6\" href=\"/ref/elementSpec\" target=\"\">elementSpec</a> for the element concerned. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.12.8\">For example, if the <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.12.8.2\" href=\"/ref/note\" target=\"\">note</a> element is not to be used in a particular application,\n          but has been included via one of the supplied modules, then the schema specification\n          concerned will contain a declaration like the following: <div class=\"tei-ex_egXML1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.12.8.4\"><pb-code-highlight language=\"xml\" theme=\"solarizedlight\">&lt;elementSpec ident=\"note\" mode=\"delete\"/&gt;</pb-code-highlight></div> The ident attribute here supplies the\n          canonical name of the element to be deleted and the mode attribute specifies\n          what is to be done with it. There is no need to specify the module concerned, since\n          element names are unique across all TEI modules. The full specification for a schema in\n          which this modification is applied would thus be something like the following: <div class=\"tei-ex_egXML1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.12.8.10\"><pb-code-highlight language=\"xml\" theme=\"solarizedlight\">&lt;schemaSpec ident=\"mySchema\"&gt;\n              &lt;moduleRef key=\"core\"/&gt;\n              &lt;!-- other modules used by this customization --&gt;\n              &lt;elementSpec ident=\"note\" mode=\"delete\"/&gt;\n            &lt;/schemaSpec&gt;</pb-code-highlight></div>\n</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.12.10\">In most cases, deletion is a clean modification, since most elements are optional.\n          Documents that are valid with respect to the modified schema are also valid according to\n          TEI-All. To say this another way, the set of documents matching the new schema is\n          contained by the set of documents matching the original schema.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.12.12\">There are however some elements in the TEI schema which have mandatory children; for\n          example, the element <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.12.12.2\" href=\"/ref/listPerson\" target=\"\">listPerson</a> must contain at least one element from the\n            <span class=\"tei-ident3 ident\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.12.12.4\">model.personLike</span> class. If that class has no members because all of its\n          member elements have been removed, then the content model cannot be satisfied. A\n          modification which keeps <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.12.12.6\" href=\"/ref/listPerson\" target=\"\">listPerson</a> but removes all of its possible children\n          would therefore be regarded as unclean. So long as at least one member of the class\n          remains available, however, deleting other members would not have this effect, and would\n          therefore be regarded as a clean modification. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.12.14\">In general, whenever the element deleted by a modification is mandatory within the\n          content model of some other (undeleted) element, the result is an unclean modification,\n          and may also break the TEI Abstract Model (<pb-link class=\"inner-ref\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.12.14.2\" emit=\"transcription\" hash=\"CFAM\" xml-id=\"CFAM\">23.4.3 Conformance to the TEI Abstract Model</pb-link>). However, the parent of\n          a mandatory child can be safely removed if it is itself optional.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.12.16\">To determine whether or not an element is mandatory in a given context, the user must\n          inspect the content model of the element concerned. In most cases, content models are\n          expressed in terms of model classes rather than elements; hence, removing an element will\n          generally be a clean modification, since there will generally be other members of the\n          class available. If a class is completely depopulated by a modification, then the\n          cleanliness of the modification will depend upon whether or not the class reference is\n          mandatory or optional, in the same way as for an individual element.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tei-div10\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.14\" id=\"MDMDCM\">\n<h4 class=\"tei-head9\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.14.4\">23.3.1.2 Modification of Content Models</h4>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.14.6\">The content model for an element in the TEI schema is defined by means of a\n            <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.14.6.2\" href=\"/ref/content\" target=\"\">content</a> element within the <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.14.6.4\" href=\"/ref/elementSpec\" target=\"\">elementSpec</a> which specifies it.

This means that the need to\n          modify content models is greatly reduced: if an element is deleted or modified, for\n          example, then the deletion or modification will be available for every content model which\n          references that element via its class, as well as those which reference it explicitly. For\n          this reason it is not (in general) good practice to replace class references by explicit\n          element references, since this may have unintended side effects. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.14.14\">An unqualified reference to an element class within a content model generates a content\n          model which is equivalent to an alternation of all the members of the class referenced.\n          Thus, a content model which refers to the model class <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.14.14.2\"><a href=\"/ref/model.phrase\">model.phrase</a></span> will generate a content model in which any one of the members of\n          that class is equally acceptable. The <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.14.14.4\" href=\"/ref/classRef\" target=\"\">classRef</a> element used to reference a class\n          has an expand attribute which may be used to vary this behaviour, for example\n          to require <span class=\"tei-q2\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.14.14.8\">an optional repeatable alternation of all members of a class</span>, <span class=\"tei-q2\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.14.14.10\">a\n            sequence containing no more than one of each member of the class</span>, etc. as described\n          further in <pb-link class=\"inner-ref\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.14.14.12\" emit=\"transcription\" hash=\"TDCLA\" xml-id=\"TDCLA\">22.6 Class Specifications</pb-link>. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.14.16\">Content model changes which are not simple restrictions on an existing model should be\n          undertaken with caution. The set of documents matching the schema which results from such\n          changes is unlikely to be contained by the set of documents matching TEI-All, and such\n          changes are therefore regarded as unclean. When content models are changed or extended,\n          care should be taken to respect the existing semantics of the element concerned as stated\n          in these Guidelines. For example, the element <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.14.16.2\" href=\"/ref/l\" target=\"\">l</a> is defined as containing a line\n          of verse. It would not therefore make sense to redefine its content model so that it could\n          also include members of the class <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.14.16.4\"><a href=\"/ref/model.pLike\">model.pLike</a></span> such as\n            <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.14.16.6\" href=\"/ref/p\" target=\"\">p</a> or <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.14.16.8\" href=\"/ref/ab\" target=\"\">ab</a>.

To add a new attribute to an element, the designer should\n          therefore first check to see whether this attribute is already available from some\n          existing attribute class. If it is, then the simplest method of adding it will be to make\n          the element in question a member of that class, as further discussed below.

If the attribute is already present, we can replace the whole of the existing\n          declaration by supplying replace as the value for mode;\n          alternatively, we can change some parts of an existing declaration only by supplying just\n          the new parts, and setting change as the value for mode.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.16.16\">Because the new attribute is not defined by the TEI, it is good practice to specify a\n          namespace for it on the <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.16.16.2\" href=\"/ref/attDef\" target=\"\">attDef</a>; see further <pb-link class=\"inner-ref\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.16.16.4\" emit=\"transcription\" hash=\"MDNS\" xml-id=\"MDNS\">23.3.2 Modification and Namespaces</pb-link>.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.16.18\">As noted above, adding the new type attribute involves changing this element's\n          class membership; we therefore discuss that in the next section (<pb-link class=\"inner-ref\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.16.18.4\" emit=\"transcription\" hash=\"MDMDCL\" xml-id=\"MDMDCL\">23.3.1.4 Class Modification</pb-link>).</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.16.20\">The canonical name for the new attribute is valid, and is supplied on the\n            ident attribute of the <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.16.20.6\" href=\"/ref/attDef\" target=\"\">attDef</a> element.

For example, to add an element to the <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.10.6\"><a href=\"/ref/att.typed\">att.typed</a></span> class, we include a declaration like the following: <div class=\"tei-ex_egXML1 full\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.10.8\"><pb-code-highlight language=\"xml\" theme=\"solarizedlight\">&lt;elementSpec ident=\"eg\" module=\"tagdocs\" mode=\"change\" ns=\"http://www.example.com/ns/nonTEI\"&gt;\n              &lt;classes mode=\"change\"&gt;\n                &lt;memberOf key=\"att.typed\"/&gt;\n              &lt;/classes&gt;\n            &lt;/elementSpec&gt;</pb-code-highlight></div> Any existing class memberships for the element being changed are\n          not affected because the mode attribute of the <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.10.12\" href=\"/ref/classes\" target=\"\">classes</a> element is set\n          to change (rather than its default value of replace). Consequently,\n          in this case, the <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.10.18\" href=\"/ref/eg\" target=\"\">eg</a> element retains its membership of the two classes (<span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.10.20\"><a href=\"/ref/model.common\">model.common</a></span> and <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.10.22\"><a href=\"/ref/model.graphicLike\">model.graphicLike</a></span>) to\n          which it already belongs. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.12\">Equally, to remove the attributes which an element inherits from its membership in some\n          class, all that is needed is to remove the relevant <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.12.2\" href=\"/ref/memberOf\" target=\"\">memberOf</a> element. For\n          example, the element <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.12.4\" href=\"/ref/term\" target=\"\">term</a> defined in the core module is a member of two attribute\n          classes, <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.12.6\"><a href=\"/ref/att.typed\">att.typed</a></span> and <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.12.8\"><a href=\"/ref/att.declaring\">att.declaring</a></span>. It inherits the attributes type and\n            subtype from the former, and the attribute decls from the latter.\n          To remove the last of these attributes from this element, we need to remove it from that\n          class: <div class=\"tei-ex_egXML1 full\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.12.16\"><pb-code-highlight language=\"xml\" theme=\"solarizedlight\">&lt;elementSpec ident=\"term\" module=\"core\" mode=\"change\"&gt;\n              &lt;classes mode=\"change\"&gt;\n                &lt;memberOf key=\"att.declaring\" mode=\"delete\"/&gt;\n              &lt;/classes&gt;\n            &lt;/elementSpec&gt;</pb-code-highlight></div>\n</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.14\">If the intention is to change the class membership of an element completely, rather than\n          simply add or remove it to or from one or more classes, the value of the mode\n          attribute of <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.14.4\" href=\"/ref/classes\" target=\"\">classes</a> can be set to replace (which is the default if no\n          value is specified), indicating that the memberships indicated by its child\n            <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.14.8\" href=\"/ref/memberOf\" target=\"\">memberOf</a> elements are the only ones applicable. Thus the following declaration:\n            <div class=\"tei-ex_egXML1 full\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.14.10\"><pb-code-highlight language=\"xml\" theme=\"solarizedlight\">&lt;elementSpec ident=\"term\" module=\"core\" mode=\"change\" ns=\"http://www.example.com/ns/nonTEI\"&gt;\n              &lt;classes mode=\"replace\"&gt;\n                &lt;memberOf key=\"att.interpLike\"/&gt;\n              &lt;/classes&gt;\n            &lt;/elementSpec&gt;</pb-code-highlight></div> would have the effect of removing the element <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.14.12\" href=\"/ref/term\" target=\"\">term</a> from\n          both its existing attribute classes, and adding it to the <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.14.14\"><a href=\"/ref/att.interpLike\">att.interpLike</a></span> class.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.16\">If however the mode attribute is set to change, the implication is\n          that the memberships indicated by its child <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.16.6\" href=\"/ref/memberOf\" target=\"\">memberOf</a> elements are to be combined\n          with the existing memberships for the element. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.18\">To change or remove attributes inherited from an attribute class for all members of the\n          class (as opposed to specific members of that class), it is also possible to modify the\n          class specification itself. For example, the class <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.18.2\"><a href=\"/ref/att.global.rendition\">att.global.rendition</a></span> defines several attributes which are available for all\n          elements, namely rend, style, and rendition. If we decide\n          that we never wish to use the rend attribute, the simplest way of removing it\n          is to supply a modified class specification for <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.18.12\"><a href=\"/ref/att.global.rendition\">att.global.rendition</a></span> as follows: <div class=\"tei-ex_egXML1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.18.14\"><pb-code-highlight language=\"xml\" theme=\"solarizedlight\">&lt;classSpec ident=\"att.global.rendition\" type=\"atts\" mode=\"change\"&gt;\n              &lt;attList&gt;\n                &lt;attDef ident=\"rend\" mode=\"delete\"/&gt;\n              &lt;/attList&gt;\n            &lt;/classSpec&gt;\n          </pb-code-highlight></div> Because the mode attribute on the <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.18.18\" href=\"/ref/classSpec\" target=\"\">classSpec</a> defining the\n          attributes inherited through membership of this class has the value change, any\n          of its existing identifiable components not specified in the modification above will\n          remain unchanged. The only effect will therefore be to delete the rend\n          attribute from the class, and hence from all elements which are members of the class.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.20\">The classes used in the TEI schema are further discussed in chapter <pb-link class=\"inner-ref\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.20.2\" emit=\"transcription\" hash=\"ST\" xml-id=\"ST\">1 The TEI Infrastructure</pb-link>.\n          Note in particular that classes are themselves classified: the attributes inherited by a\n          member of attribute class A may come to it directly from that class, or from another class\n          of which A is itself a member. For example, the class <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.20.4\"><a href=\"/ref/att.global\">att.global</a></span> is itself a member of the classes <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.20.6\"><a href=\"/ref/att.global.linking\">att.global.linking</a></span> and <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.20.8\"><a href=\"/ref/att.global.analytic\">att.global.analytic</a></span>. By\n          default, these two classes are predefined as empty. However, if (for example) the <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.20.10\"><a href=\"/ref/linking\">linking</a></span> module is included in a schema, a number of attributes\n            (corresp, sameAs, etc.) are defined as members of the <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.20.16\"><a href=\"/ref/att.global.linking\">att.global.linking</a></span> class. All elements which are members of <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.20.18\"><a href=\"/ref/att.global\">att.global</a></span> will then inherit these new attributes (see further\n          section <pb-link class=\"inner-ref\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.20.20\" emit=\"transcription\" hash=\"STECAT\" xml-id=\"STECAT\">1.3.1 Attribute Classes</pb-link>). A new attribute may thus be added to the global class in\n          two ways: either by adding it to the <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.20.22\" href=\"/ref/attList\" target=\"\">attList</a> defined within the class\n          specification for <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.20.24\"><a href=\"/ref/att.global\">att.global</a></span>; or by defining a new attribute\n          class, and changing the class membership of the <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.20.26\"><a href=\"/ref/att.global\">att.global</a></span>\n          class to reference it. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.22\">Such global changes should be undertaken with caution: in general removing existing\n          non-mandatory attributes from a class will always be a clean modification, in the same way\n          as removing non-mandatory elements. Adding a new attribute to a class however can be a\n          clean modification only if the new attribute is labelled as belonging to some namespace\n          other than the TEI.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.18.24\">The same mechanisms are available for modification of model classes. Care should be taken\n          when modifying the model class membership of existing elements since model class\n          membership is what determines the content model of most elements in the TEI schema, and a\n          small change may have unintended consequences. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tei-div10\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.20\" id=\"MDMDNE\">\n<h4 class=\"tei-head9\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.20.4\">23.3.1.5 Addition of New Elements</h4>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.20.6\">To add a completely new element into a schema involves providing a complete element\n          specification for it. It is recommended that the <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.20.6.2\" href=\"/ref/classes\" target=\"\">classes</a> element of this new\n          declaration should include a reference to at least one TEI model class. Without such a\n          reference, the new element would not otherwise be referenced by the content model of any\n          other TEI element, and would therefore be inaccessible within a TEI document. It is also\n          possible to modify the content models of one or more existing elements to refer to the new\n          element explicitly, as discussed in <pb-link class=\"inner-ref\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.20.6.4\" emit=\"transcription\" hash=\"MDMDCM\" xml-id=\"MDMDCM\">23.3.1.2 Modification of Content Models</pb-link>\n           but this will generally be less convenient. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.20.8\">For example, the three elements <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.20.8.2\" href=\"/ref/bibl\" target=\"\">bibl</a>, <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.20.8.4\" href=\"/ref/biblFull\" target=\"\">biblFull</a>, and <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.20.8.6\" href=\"/ref/biblStruct\" target=\"\">biblStruct</a>\n          are all defined as members of the class <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.20.8.8\"><a href=\"/ref/model.biblLike\">model.biblLike</a></span>.

The most appropriate action is to explicitly attach the new\n        attribute to a new namespace by a declaration such as the following: <div class=\"tei-ex_egXML1 full\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.24.10.8\"><pb-code-highlight language=\"xml\" theme=\"solarizedlight\">\n          &lt;elementSpec ident=\"p\" mode=\"change\"&gt;\n            &lt;attList&gt;\n              &lt;attDef ident=\"topic\" mode=\"add\" ns=\"http://www.example.org/ns/nonTEI\"&gt;\n                &lt;desc&gt;indicates the topic of a TEI paragraph&lt;/desc&gt;\n                &lt;datatype&gt;&lt;dataRef key=\"teidata.word\"/&gt;&lt;/datatype&gt;\n              &lt;/attDef&gt;\n            &lt;/attList&gt;\n          &lt;/elementSpec&gt;</pb-code-highlight></div>\n</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.24.12\">Document instances using a schema derived from this ODD can now indicate clearly the status\n        of this attribute: <div class=\"tei-ex_egXML1 full\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.24.12.2\"><pb-code-highlight language=\"xml\" theme=\"solarizedlight\">\n          &lt;div xmlns:my=\"http://www.example.org/ns/nonTEI\"&gt;\n            &lt;!-- ... --&gt;\n            &lt;p n=\"12\" my:topic=\"rabbits\"&gt;Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail, and Peter...&lt;/p&gt;\n          &lt;/div&gt;</pb-code-highlight></div></p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.24.14\">Since topic is explicitly labelled as belonging to something\n        other than the TEI namespace, we regard the modification which introduced it as clean. A\n        namespace-aware processor will be able to validate those elements in the TEI namespace\n        against the unmodified schema.<a class=\"note tei-note\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.24.14.4\" href=\"#fn_1_7_4_46_16_24_14_4\" id=\"fnref_1_7_4_46_16_24_14_4\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.24.16\">Similar considerations apply when modification is made to the content model or some other\n        aspect of an element, or when a new element is declared.\n        All such changes should be explicitly\n        labelled as belonging to some non-TEI namespace or to no namespace at all.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.24.18\">If the ns attribute is supplied on a <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.24.18.4\" href=\"/ref/schemaSpec\" target=\"\">schemaSpec</a> element, it identifies\n        the namespace applicable to all components of the schema being specified. Even if such a\n        schema includes unmodified modules from the TEI namespace, the elements contained by such\n        modules will now be regarded as belonging to the namespace specified on the\n          <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.24.18.6\" href=\"/ref/schemaSpec\" target=\"\">schemaSpec</a>. This can be useful if it is desired simply to avoid namespace\n        processing. For example, the following schema specification results in a schema called\n          <span class=\"tei-ident3 ident\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.24.18.8\">noName</span> which has no namespace, even though it comprises declarations from\n        the TEI <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.24.18.10\"><a href=\"/ref/header\">header</a></span> module: <div class=\"tei-ex_egXML1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.24.18.12\"><pb-code-highlight language=\"xml\" theme=\"solarizedlight\">&lt;schemaSpec ns=\"\" ident=\"noName\"&gt;\n            &lt;moduleRef key=\"header\"/&gt;\n            &lt;!-- ... --&gt;\n          &lt;/schemaSpec&gt;</pb-code-highlight></div>\n</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.24.20\">In addition to the TEI canonical namespace mentioned above, the TEI may also define\n        namespaces for approved translations of the TEI schema into other languages.\n        \n        The namespace for such translations is the same as that for the canonical namespace,\n        suffixed by the appropriate ISO language identifier (<pb-link class=\"inner-ref\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.24.20.4\" emit=\"transcription\" hash=\"CHSH\" xml-id=\"CHSH\">6.1 Language Identification</pb-link>). A schema\n        specification using the Chinese translation, for example, would use the namespace <span class=\"tei-ident2\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.24.20.6\">http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0/zh</span>\n</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tei-div10\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.26\" id=\"MDDO\">\n<h3 class=\"tei-head9\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.26.4\">23.3.3 Documenting the Modification</h3>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.26.6\">The elements used to define a TEI customization (<a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.26.6.2\" href=\"/ref/schemaSpec\" target=\"\">schemaSpec</a>, <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.26.6.4\" href=\"/ref/moduleRef\" target=\"\">moduleRef</a>,\n          <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.26.6.6\" href=\"/ref/elementSpec\" target=\"\">elementSpec</a>, etc.) will typically be used within a TEI document which supplies\n        further information about the intended use of the new schema, the meaning and application of\n        any new or modified elements within it, and so on. This document will typically conform to a\n         schema which includes components from the module described in\n        chapter <pb-link class=\"inner-ref\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.26.6.10\" emit=\"transcription\" hash=\"TD\" xml-id=\"TD\">22 Documentation Elements</pb-link>.<a class=\"note tei-note\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.26.6.12\" href=\"#fn_1_7_4_46_16_26_6_12\" id=\"fnref_1_7_4_46_16_26_6_12\" rel=\"footnote\">4</a></p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.26.8\">Where the customization to be documented simply consists in a selection of TEI modules,\n        perhaps with some deletion of unwanted elements or attributes, the documentation need not\n        specify anything further. Even here however it may be considered worthwhile to replace some\n        of the semantic information provided by the unmodified TEI specification. For example, the\n          <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.26.8.2\" href=\"/ref/desc\" target=\"\">desc</a> element of an unmodified TEI <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.26.8.4\" href=\"/ref/elementSpec\" target=\"\">elementSpec</a> may describe an element in\n        terms more general than appropriate to a particular project, or the <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.26.8.6\" href=\"/ref/exemplum\" target=\"\">exemplum</a>\n        elements within it may not illustrate the project's actual intended usage of the element, or\n        the <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.26.8.8\" href=\"/ref/remarks\" target=\"\">remarks</a> element may contain discussions of matters irrelevant to the project.\n        These elements may therefore be replaced or deleted within an <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.26.8.10\" href=\"/ref/elementSpec\" target=\"\">elementSpec</a> as\n        necessary. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.26.12\">Radical revision is also possible. It is feasible to produce a modification in which the\n          <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.26.12.2\" href=\"/ref/teiHeader\" target=\"\">teiHeader</a> or <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.26.12.4\" href=\"/ref/text\" target=\"\">text</a> elements are not required, or in which any other rule\n        stated in these Guidelines is either not enforced or not enforceable. In fact, the\n        mechanism, if used in an extreme way, permits replacement of all that the TEI has to say\n        about every component of its schema. Such revisions would result in documents that are not\n        TEI-conformant in even the broadest sense, and it is not intended that encoders use the\n        mechanism in this way.

Such a document \n      cannot necessarily be transformed automatically to a TEI-conformant document without loss of\n      information. However, since one of the goals of the TEI is to support extensions and\n      modifications, it should not be assumed that no TEI document can include extensions: an\n      extension which is expressed by means of the recommended mechanisms is also a TEI-conformant\n      document provided that those parts of it which are not extensions are\n      TEI-conformant.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.16\">A TEI-conformant document is said to follow <span class=\"tei-term\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.16.4\">TEI Recommended\n        Practice</span> if, wherever these Guidelines prefer one encoding practice to another, the\n      preferred practice is used.</p>\n<div class=\"tei-div10\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.18\" id=\"CFWF\">\n<h3 class=\"tei-head9\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.18.4\">23.4.1 Well-formedness Criterion</h3>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.18.6\">These Guidelines mandate the use of well-formed XML as representation format.

With the\n        release of P5, the only representation format supported by these Guidelines became valid\n        XML; legacy documents in SGML format should therefore be converted using appropriate\n        software.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.18.10\">A TEI-conformant document must use the TEI namespace, and therefore must also include an\n        XML-conformant namespace declaration, as defined below (<pb-link class=\"inner-ref\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.18.10.2\" emit=\"transcription\" hash=\"CFNS\" xml-id=\"CFNS\">23.4.4 Use of the TEI Namespace</pb-link>).</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.18.12\">The use of XML greatly reduces the need to consider hardware or software differences\n        between processing environments when exchanging data. No special packing or interchange\n        format is required for an XML document, beyond that defined by the W3C recommendations, and\n        no special interchange format is therefore proposed by these\n        Guidelines.

These Guidelines also define classes of elements, which\n        have both semantic and structural properties in common. Those semantic and structural\n        properties are also a part of the TEI Abstract Model; the class membership of an existing\n        TEI element cannot therefore be changed without changing the model. Elements can however be\n        removed from a class by deletion, and new non-TEI elements within their own namespaces can\n        be added to existing TEI classes.</p>\n<div class=\"tei-div10\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.22.8\" id=\"CFAMsc\">\n<h4 class=\"tei-head9\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.22.8.4\">23.4.3.1 Semantic Constraints</h4>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.22.8.6\">It is an important condition of TEI conformance that elements defined in the TEI\n          Guidelines as having one specific meaning should not be used with another. For example,\n          the element <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.22.8.6.2\" href=\"/ref/l\" target=\"\">l</a> is defined in the TEI Guidelines as containing a line of verse. A\n          schema in which it is redefined to mean a typographic line, or an ordered queue of objects\n          of some kind, cannot therefore be TEI-conformant, whatever its other properties.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.22.8.8\">The semantics of elements defined in the TEI Guidelines are conveyed in a number of ways,\n          ranging from formally verifiable datatypes to informal descriptive prose. In addition, a\n          mapping between TEI elements and concepts in other conceptual models may be provided by\n          the <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.22.8.8.2\" href=\"/ref/equiv\" target=\"\">equiv</a> element where this is available. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.22.8.10\">A schema which shares equivalent concepts to those of the TEI conceptual model may be\n          mappable to the TEI Schema by means of such a mechanism. For example, the concept of\n          paragraph expressed in the TEI schema by the <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.22.8.10.2\" href=\"/ref/p\" target=\"\">p</a> element is probably the same\n          concept as that expressed in the DocBook schema by the <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.22.8.10.4\" href=\"/ref/para\" target=\"\">para</a> element.\n          Such\n          areas of overlap facilitate\n          interchange\n          because elements from one namespace may be readily integrated with those from another, but\n          do not affect the definition of conformance.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.22.8.12\">A document is said to conform to the <span class=\"tei-term\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.22.8.12.2\">TEI Abstract Model</span> if features for\n          which an encoding is proposed by the TEI Guidelines are encoded within it using the markup\n          and other syntactic properties defined by means of a valid <span class=\"tei-term\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.22.8.12.4\">TEI-conformant</span>\n          schema. Hence, even though the names of elements or attributes may vary, a TEI-conformant\n          document must respect the TEI Semantic Model, and be valid with respect to a\n          TEI-conformant Schema. Although it may be possible to transform a document which follows\n          the <span class=\"tei-term\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.22.8.12.6\">TEI Abstract Model</span> into a <span class=\"tei-term\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.22.8.12.8\">TEI-conformant</span> document, such a\n          document is not itself conformant.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.22.8.14\">As noted above, the notion of semantic conformance cannot be completely enforced in a\n          formal way. The TEI conceptual model is expressed by means of formal specification in a\n          customization file, by means of descriptive prose in the body of these Guidelines, and\n          implicitly by examples of usage. Any inconsistency between, for example, the text of these\n          Guidelines and a part of a specification should be considered an error and reported to the\n          TEI Council for correction. </p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tei-div10\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.22.10\" id=\"CFAMmc\">\n<h4 class=\"tei-head9\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.22.10.4\">23.4.3.2 Mandatory Components of a TEI Document</h4>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.22.10.6\">It is a long-standing requirement for any <span class=\"tei-term\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.22.10.6.2\">TEI-conformant</span> document that it\n          should contain a <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.22.10.6.4\" href=\"/ref/teiHeader\" target=\"\">teiHeader</a> element.

While the scope of the TEI is large, there are many\n        areas in which it makes no particular recommendation, or where it recommends that other\n        defined markup schemas should be adopted, such as graphics or mathematics. It is also\n        considered desirable that users of other markup schemas should be able to integrate\n        documents using TEI markup with their own system.

It is assumed, for example, that most projects will customize\n        the TEI schema by removing those elements that are not needed for the texts they are\n        encoding, and by providing further constraints on the attribute values and element content\n        models the TEI provides. All such customizations must be specified by means of a valid\n          <span class=\"tei-term\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.26.6.12\">TEI ODD</span> file. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.26.8\">As different sorts of customization have different implications for the interchange and\n        interoperability of TEI documents, it cannot be assumed that every customization will\n        necessarily result in a schema that validates only TEI-conformant documents. The ODD\n        language permits modifications which conflict with the TEI Abstract Model, even though\n        observing this model is a requirement for TEI Conformance. The ODD language can in fact be\n        used to describe many kinds of markup schema, including schemas which have nothing to do\n        with the TEI at all. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.26.10\">Equally, it is possible to construct a TEI Schema which is identical to that derived from a\n        given TEI ODD file without using the ODD schema. A schema can constructed simply by\n        combining the predefined schema language fragments corresponding with the required set of\n        TEI modules and other statements in the relevant schema language. However, the status of\n        such a schema with respect to the <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.26.10.2\"><a href=\"/ref/tei_all\">tei_all</a></span> schema cannot in\n        general be easily determined; it may therefore be impractical to determine whether such a\n        schema represents a clean modification or an extension.

firstly that each sample document assessed here is a well-formed XML document,\n        and that it is valid against some schema. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.28.12\">The document in column A is TEI-conformant. Its tagging follows the TEI Abstract Model,\n        both as regards syntactic constraints (its <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.28.12.2\" href=\"/ref/l\" target=\"\">l</a> elements appear within <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.28.12.4\" href=\"/ref/div\" target=\"\">div</a>\n        elements and not the reverse) and semantic constraints (its <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.28.12.6\" href=\"/ref/l\" target=\"\">l</a> elements appear to\n        contain verse lines rather than typographic ones). It is accompanied by a valid ODD which\n        documents exactly how it uses the TEI. All the TEI-defined elements and attributes in the\n        document are placed in the TEI namespace. The schema against which it is valid is a\n          clean subset of the <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.28.12.10\"><a href=\"/ref/tei_all\">tei_all</a></span> schema. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.28.14\">The document in column B is not a TEI document. Although it is accompanied by a valid TEI\n        ODD, the resulting schema includes some unclean modifications, and\n        represents some concepts from the TEI Abstract Model using non-TEI elements; for example, it\n        re-defines the content model of <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.28.14.4\" href=\"/ref/p\" target=\"\">p</a> to permit <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.28.14.6\" href=\"/ref/div\" target=\"\">div</a> within it, and it includes\n        an element <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.28.14.8\" href=\"/ref/pageTrimming\" target=\"\">pageTrimming</a> which appears to have the same meaning\n        as the existing TEI <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.28.14.10\" href=\"/ref/fw\" target=\"\">fw</a> element, but the equivalence is not made explicit in the\n        ODD. It uses the TEI namespace correctly to identify the TEI elements it contains, but the\n        ODD does not contain enough information automatically to convert its non-TEI elements into\n        TEI equivalents.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.28.16\">The document in column C is  TEI conformant. It is almost the same as\n        the document in column A, except that the names of the elements used are not those specified\n        for the TEI namespace. Because the ODD accompanying it contains an exact mapping for each\n        element name (using the <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.28.16.4\" href=\"/ref/altIdent\" target=\"\">altIdent</a> element) and there are no name conflicts, it is\n        possible to make an automatic conversion of this document.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.28.18\">The document in column D is a TEI Extension. It combines elements from its own namespace\n        with unmodified TEI elements in the TEI namespace. Its usage of TEI elements conforms to the\n        TEI Abstract Model. Its ODD defines a new <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.28.18.2\" href=\"/ref/blort\" target=\"\">blort</a> element which\n        has no exact TEI equivalent, but which is assigned to an existing TEI class; consequently\n        its schema is not a clean subset of <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.28.18.4\"><a href=\"/ref/tei_all\">tei_all</a></span>. If the associated\n        ODD provided a way of mapping this element to an existing TEI element, then this would be\n        TEI-conformant.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.28.20\">The document in column E is superficially similar to document D, but because it does not\n        use any namespace declarations (or, equivalently, it assigns unmodified TEI elements to its\n        own namespace), it may contain name collisions; there is no way of knowing whether a\n          <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.28.20.2\" href=\"/ref/p\" target=\"\">p</a> within it is the same as the TEI's <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.28.20.4\" href=\"/ref/p\" target=\"\">p</a> or has some other meaning. The\n        accompanying ODD file may be used to provide the human reader with information about\n        equivalently named elements in the TEI namespace, and hence to determine whether the\n        document is valid with respect to the TEI Abstract Model but this is not an automatable\n        process. In particular, cases of apparent conflict (for example use of an element <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.28.20.6\" href=\"/ref/p\" target=\"\">p</a>\n        to represent a concept not in the TEI Abstract Model but in the abstract model of some other\n        system, whose namespace has been removed as well) cannot be reliably resolved. By our\n        current definition therefore, this is not a TEI document.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.28.22\">The document in column F is TEI-conformant. The difference between it and that in\n        column D is that the new element <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.28.22.4\" href=\"/ref/blort\" target=\"\">blort</a> which is used in this\n        document is a specialization of an existing TEI element, and the ODD in which it is defined\n        specifies the mapping (a <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.28.22.6\" href=\"/ref/my:blort\" target=\"\">my:blort</a> may be automatically converted\n        to a tei:seg type=\"blort\", for example). For this to work, however, the <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.28.22.10\" href=\"/ref/blort\" target=\"\">blort</a> must observe the same syntactic constraints as the\n          <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.28.22.12\" href=\"/ref/seg\" target=\"\">seg</a>; if it does not, this would also be a case of TEI Extension.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.28.24\">The document in column G is not a TEI document. Its structure is fully documented by a\n        valid TEI ODD, but it does not claim to represent the TEI Abstract Model, does not use the\n        TEI namespace, and is not intended to validate against any TEI schema. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.28.26\">The document in column H is very like that in column A, but it lacks an accompanying ODD.\n        Instead, the schema used to validate it is produced simply by combining TEI schema fragments\n        in the same way as an ODD processor would, given the ODD. If the resulting schema is a clean\n        subset of <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.28.26.2\"><a href=\"/ref/tei_all\">tei_all</a></span>, such a document is indistinguishable from a\n        TEI-conformant one, but there is no way of determining (without inspection) whether this is\n        the case if any modification or extension has been applied. Its status is therefore, like\n        that of Text E, impossible to determine.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tei-div10\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20\" id=\"IM\">\n<h2 class=\"tei-head9\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.4\">23.5 Implementation of an ODD System</h2>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.6\">This section specifies how a processing system may take advantage of the markup specification\n      elements documented in chapter <pb-link class=\"inner-ref\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.6.2\" emit=\"transcription\" hash=\"TD\" xml-id=\"TD\">22 Documentation Elements</pb-link> of these Guidelines in order to produce\n      project specific user documentation, schemas in one or more schema languages, and validation\n      tools for other processors.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.8\">The specifications in this section are illustrative but not normative.

Next, the resulting unified\n      ODD must be processed to produce the desired outputs.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.12\">An ODD processor is not required to do these two stages in sequence, but that may well be the\n      simplest approach; the ODD processing tools currently provided by the TEI Consortium, which\n      are also used to process the source of these Guidelines, adopt this approach.</p>\n<div class=\"tei-div10\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.14\" id=\"IM-unified\">\n<h3 class=\"tei-head9\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.14.3\">23.5.1 Making a Unified ODD</h3>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.14.5\">An ODD customization must contain a single <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.14.5.2\" href=\"/ref/schemaSpec\" target=\"\">schemaSpec</a> element, which defines the\n        schema to be constructed. <ul class=\"tei-specList specList\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.14.5.4\">\n<li class=\"tei-specDesc specDesc\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.14.5.4.2\"><span><span class=\"element\">&lt;<a href=\"/ref/schemaSpec\">schemaSpec</a>&gt; </span><span><span class=\"tei-desc2\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.44.21.18.14.15\">generates a TEI-conformant schema and documentation for it.</span></span></span></li>\n</ul> Amongst other attributes inherited from the <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.14.5.6\"><a href=\"/ref/att.identified\">att.identified</a></span> class, this element also carries a required ident\n        attribute.

For example, consider this simple\n        modification: <div class=\"tei-ex_egXML1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.14.13.2\"><pb-code-highlight language=\"xml\" theme=\"solarizedlight\">\n          &lt;elementSpec ident=\"p\"&gt;\n            &lt;classes&gt;\n              &lt;memberOf key=\"att.typed\"/&gt;\n            &lt;/classes&gt;\n            &lt;!-- ... --&gt;\n          &lt;/elementSpec&gt;\n        </pb-code-highlight></div> The effect of its membership in the <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.14.13.4\"><a href=\"/ref/att.typed\">att.typed</a></span> class is\n        to provide <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.14.13.6\" href=\"/ref/p\" target=\"\">p</a> with a type attribute and a subtype attribute.\n        If we wish <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.14.13.12\" href=\"/ref/p\" target=\"\">p</a> to not have subtype, we could extend the\n        customization in our schema as follows: <div class=\"tei-ex_egXML1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.14.13.18\"><pb-code-highlight language=\"xml\" theme=\"solarizedlight\">\n          &lt;elementSpec ident=\"p\"&gt;\n            &lt;classes&gt;\n              &lt;memberOf key=\"att.typed\"/&gt;\n            &lt;/classes&gt;\n            &lt;!-- ... --&gt;\n            &lt;attList&gt;\n              &lt;attDef ident=\"subtype\" mode=\"delete\"/&gt;\n            &lt;/attList&gt;\n          &lt;/elementSpec&gt;\n        </pb-code-highlight></div> This means that when memberOf key=\"att.typed\"/ is processed, that class\n        is looked up, each attribute which it defines is examined in turn, and the customization is\n        searched for an override. If the modification is of the attribute class itself, work\n        proceeds as usual; if, however, the modification is at the element level, the class\n        reference is deleted and a series of <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.14.13.22\" href=\"/ref/attRef\" target=\"\">attRef</a> elements is added to the element, one\n        for each attribute inherited from the class. Since attribute classes can themselves be\n        members of other attribute classes, membership must be followed recursively.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.14.15\">The effect of the concatenation of unidentifiable components should be considered\n        carefully. An original may have <div class=\"tei-ex_egXML1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.14.15.2\"><pb-code-highlight language=\"xml\" theme=\"solarizedlight\">\n          &lt;elementSpec ident=\"p\"&gt;\n            &lt;desc&gt;marks paragraphs in prose.&lt;/desc&gt;\n            &lt;!-- ... --&gt;\n          &lt;/elementSpec&gt;\n        </pb-code-highlight></div> which would usefully be extended with this: <div class=\"tei-ex_egXML1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.14.15.4\"><pb-code-highlight language=\"xml\" theme=\"solarizedlight\">\n          &lt;elementSpec ident=\"p\" mode=\"change\"&gt;\n            &lt;desc xml:lang=\"es\"&gt;marca párrafos en prosa.&lt;/desc&gt;\n            &lt;!-- ... --&gt;\n          &lt;/elementSpec&gt;\n        </pb-code-highlight></div> to provide an alternate description in another language. Nothing prevents the user\n        from supplying <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.14.15.6\" href=\"/ref/desc\" target=\"\">desc</a> several times in the same language, and subsequent applications\n        will have to decide what that may mean.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.14.17\">Similar considerations apply to multiple example elements, though these are less likely to\n        cause problems in documentation.

On the one hand,\n        the schema can try to maintain all the flexibility of ODD by using the facilities of the\n        schema language for parameterization; on the other, it can remove all customization features\n        and produce a flat result which is not suitable for further manipulation. The TEI project\n        currently generates both styles of schema; the first as a set of schema fragments in DTD and\n        RELAX NG languages, which can be included as modules in other schemas, and customized\n        further; the second as the output from a processor such as Roma, in which many of the\n        parameterization features have been removed.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.13\">The difference between the schema styles may be illustrated by considering this ODD\n        specification: <div class=\"tei-ex_egXML1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.13.2\"><pb-code-highlight language=\"xml\" theme=\"solarizedlight\">\n          &lt;elementSpec module=\"drama\" ident=\"performance\"&gt;\n            &lt;!-- ... --&gt;\n            &lt;classes&gt;\n              &lt;memberOf key=\"model.frontPart.drama\"/&gt;\n            &lt;/classes&gt;\n            &lt;content&gt;\n              &lt;sequence&gt;\n                &lt;alternate minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"unbounded\"&gt;\n                  &lt;classRef key=\"model.divTop\"/&gt;\n                  &lt;classRef key=\"model.global\"/&gt;\n                &lt;/alternate&gt;\n                &lt;sequence minOccurs=\"1\" maxOccurs=\"unbounded\"&gt;\n                  &lt;classRef key=\"model.common\"/&gt;\n                  &lt;classRef key=\"model.global\" minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"unbounded\"/&gt;\n                &lt;/sequence&gt;\n                &lt;sequence minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"unbounded\"&gt;\n                  &lt;classRef key=\"model.divBottom\"/&gt;\n                  &lt;classRef key=\"model.global\" minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"unbounded\"/&gt;\n                &lt;/sequence&gt;\n              &lt;/sequence&gt;\n            &lt;/content&gt;\n            &lt;!-- ... --&gt;\n          &lt;/elementSpec&gt;\n        </pb-code-highlight></div> A simple rendering to RELAX NG produces this:\n        <div class=\"tei-eg example\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.13.4\"><pb-code-highlight theme=\"solarizedlight\"><template>performance =\n element performance { \n  (model.divTop | model.global)*,\n  (model.common, model.global*)+,\n  (model.divBottom, model.global*)*\n  att.global.attribute.xmlspace,\n  att.global.attribute.xmlid,\n  att.global.attribute.n,\n  att.global.attribute.xmllang,\n  att.global.attribute.rend,\n  att.global.attribute.xmlbase,\n  att.global.linking.attribute.corresp,\n  att.global.linking.attribute.synch,\n  att.global.linking.attribute.sameAs,\n  att.global.linking.attribute.copyOf,\n  att.global.linking.attribute.next,\n  att.global.linking.attribute.prev,\n  att.global.linking.attribute.exclude,\n  att.global.linking.attribute.select\n}</template></pb-code-highlight></div> In the above, a subsequent redefinition of the attribute class (such as <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.13.6\"><a href=\"/ref/att.global\">att.global</a></span>) would have no effect, since references to such classes have been\n        expanded to reference their constituent attributes.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.15\"> The equivalent parameterized version might look like this:\n        <div class=\"tei-eg example\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.15.2\"><pb-code-highlight theme=\"solarizedlight\"><template>performance =\n  element performance { performance.content, performance.attributes }\nperformance.content =\n  (model.divTop | model.global)*,\n  (model.common, model.global*)+,\n  (model.divBottom, model.global*)*\nperformance.attributes = att.global.attributes, empty</template></pb-code-highlight></div> Here, the attribute class <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.15.4\"><a href=\"/ref/att.global\">att.global</a></span> is provided via an\n        explicit reference (<span class=\"tei-code2 code\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.15.6\">att.global.attributes</span>), and can therefore be redefined.\n        Moreover, the attributes are separated from the content model, allowing either to be\n        overridden.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.17\">In the remainder of these section, the terms <span class=\"tei-term\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.17.2\">simple schema</span> and\n          <span class=\"tei-term\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.17.4\">parameterized schema</span> are used to distinguish the two schema types. An ODD\n        processor is not required to support both, though the simple schema output is generally\n        preferable for most applications.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.19\">Thirdly, the problem of missing components must be resolved. For example, consider this\n        (fictitious) model for <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.19.2\" href=\"/ref/sp\" target=\"\">sp</a>: <div class=\"tei-ex_egXML1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.19.4\"><pb-code-highlight language=\"xml\" theme=\"solarizedlight\">\n          &lt;elementSpec ident=\"sp\"&gt;\n            &lt;!-- ... --&gt;\n            &lt;content&gt;\n              &lt;classRef key=\"model.global\" minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"unbounded\"/&gt;\n              &lt;sequence minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"1\"&gt;\n                &lt;elementRef key=\"speaker\"/&gt;\n                &lt;classRef key=\"model.global\" minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"unbounded\"/&gt;\n              &lt;/sequence&gt;\n            &lt;/content&gt;\n            &lt;!-- ... --&gt;\n          &lt;/elementSpec&gt;\n        </pb-code-highlight></div> This proposes anything from the class <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.19.6\"><a href=\"/ref/model.global\">model.global</a></span>,\n        followed optionally by a <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.19.8\" href=\"/ref/speaker\" target=\"\">speaker</a> element followed by anything from the <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.19.10\"><a href=\"/ref/model.global\">model.global</a></span> class. What happens if <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.19.12\" href=\"/ref/speaker\" target=\"\">speaker</a> is removed from\n        the schema? The following would result: <div class=\"tei-ex_egXML1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.19.14\"><pb-code-highlight language=\"xml\" theme=\"solarizedlight\">\n          &lt;elementSpec ident=\"sp\"&gt;\n            &lt;!-- ... --&gt;\n            &lt;content&gt;\n              &lt;classRef key=\"model.global\" minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"unbounded\"/&gt;\n              &lt;classRef key=\"model.global\" minOccurs=\"0\" maxOccurs=\"unbounded\"/&gt;\n            &lt;/content&gt;\n            &lt;!-- ... --&gt;\n          &lt;/elementSpec&gt;\n        </pb-code-highlight></div> which is illegal in DTD and W3C schema languages, since for a given member of\n          <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.19.16\"><a href=\"/ref/model.global\">model.global</a></span> it is impossible to be sure which rule is being\n        used. This situation is not detected when RELAX NG is used, since the language is able to\n        cope with non-deterministic content models of this kind and does not require that only a\n        single rule be used. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.23\">Finally, an application will need to have some method of associating the schema with\n        document instances that use it. The TEI does not mandate any particular method of doing\n        this, since different schema languages and processors vary considerably in their\n        requirements. ODD processors may wish to build in support for some of the methods for\n        associating a document instance with a schema. The TEI does not mandate any particular\n        method, but does suggest that those which are already part of XML (the DOCTYPE declaration\n        for DTDs) and W3C Schema (the xsi:schemaLocation attribute) be supported where\n        possible.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.25\">In order for the xsi:schemaLocation attribute to be valid when a document is\n        validated against either a DTD or a RELAX NG schema, ODD processors may wish to add\n        declarations for this attribute and its namespace to the root element, even though these are\n        not part of the TEI <span class=\"tei-foreign\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.25.4\">per se</span>. For DTDs this means adding <div class=\"tei-eg example\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.25.6\"><pb-code-highlight theme=\"solarizedlight\"><template>xsi:schemaLocation CDATA #IMPLIED xmlns:xsi CDATA #FIXED\n'http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance'</template></pb-code-highlight></div> to the list of attributes on the root element,\n        which permits the non-namespace-aware DTD language to recognize the\n          <span class=\"tei-code2 code\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.25.8\">xsi:schemaLocation</span> notation. For RELAX NG, the namespace and attribute would\n        be declared in the usual way: <div class=\"tei-eg example\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.25.10\"><pb-code-highlight theme=\"solarizedlight\"><template>namespace xsi =\n\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"</template></pb-code-highlight></div> and <div class=\"tei-eg example\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.25.12\"><pb-code-highlight theme=\"solarizedlight\"><template>attribute\nxsi:schemaLocation { list { teidata.namespace, teidata.pointer }+ }</template></pb-code-highlight></div> inside the root element\n        declaration.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.27\">Note that declaration of the xsi:schemaLocation attribute in a W3C Schema schema\n        is not permitted. Therefore, if W3C Schemas are being generated by converting the RELAX NG\n        schema (for example, with <span class=\"tei-name\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.27.4\">trang</span>), it may be necessary to perform that\n        conversion prior to adding the xsi:schemaLocation declaration to the RELAX\n        NG.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.16.29\">It is recognized that this is an unsatisfactory solution, but it permits users to take\n        advantage of the W3C Schema facility for indicating a schema, while still permitting\n        documents to be validated using DTD and RELAX NG processors without any conflict.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tei-div10\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.18\" id=\"IM-naming\">\n<h3 class=\"tei-head9\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.18.3\">23.5.3 Names and Documentation in Generated Schemas</h3>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.18.5\">When processing class, element, or macro specifications, there are three general rules:\n          <ol class=\"tei-list1 numbered\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.18.5.2\">\n<li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.18.5.2.3\">If a RELAX NG pattern or DTD parameter entity is being created, its name is the\n            value of the corresponding ident attribute, prefixed by the value of any\n              prefix attribute on <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.18.5.2.3.6\" href=\"/ref/schemaSpec\" target=\"\">schemaSpec</a>.

For example, if there are several with different values\n            of xml:lang, a locale indication in the processing environment might be used\n            to decide which to use.

All such\n          parameter entities are declared by default with the value IGNORE: to select a\n          module, therefore, the encoder declares the appropriate parameter entities with the value\n            INCLUDE. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.7.8\">For XML DTD fragments, note that some modules generate two DTD fragments: for example the\n            <span class=\"tei-ident1\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.7.8.2\"><a href=\"/ref/analysis\">analysis</a></span> module generates fragments called <span class=\"tei-ident2\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.7.8.4\">analysis-decl</span> and <span class=\"tei-ident2\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.7.8.6\">analysis</span>.

The parameter\n          entities used for this purpose have exactly the same name as the generic identifier of the\n          element concerned. The default definition for these parameter entities is\n            INCLUDE but they may be changed to IGNORE in order to exclude the\n          standard element and attribute definition list declarations from the DTD. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.9.8\">The declarations for the element <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.9.8.2\" href=\"/ref/p\" target=\"\">p</a>, for example, are preceded by a definition\n          for a parameter entity with the name <span class=\"tei-ident2 noindex\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.9.8.4\">p</span> and\n          contained within a marked section whose keyword is given as <span class=\"tei-code2 code\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.9.8.6\">%p;</span>: <div class=\"tei-eg example\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.9.8.8\"><pb-code-highlight theme=\"solarizedlight\"><template>&lt;!ENTITY % p 'INCLUDE' &gt;\n&lt;![ %p; [\n       &lt;!-- element and attribute list declaration for p here --&gt;\n]]</template></pb-code-highlight></div></p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.9.10\">These parameter entities are defined immediately preceding the element whose declarations\n          they control; because their names are completely regular, they are not documented further. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.9.12\">To define a DTD in which the element <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.9.12.2\" href=\"/ref/p\" target=\"\">p</a> is excluded therefore, the entity <span class=\"tei-ident2 noindex\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.9.12.4\">p</span> needs to be redefined as IGNORE by\n          ensuring that a declaration such as\n          <div class=\"tei-eg example\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.9.12.8\"><pb-code-highlight theme=\"solarizedlight\"><template>&lt;!ENTITY % p 'IGNORE' &gt;</template></pb-code-highlight></div> is added earlier in the\n          DTD than the default (see further <pb-link class=\"inner-ref\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.9.12.10\" emit=\"transcription\" hash=\"STOVLO\" xml-id=\"STOVLO\">23.5.7.4 Embedding Local Modifications (DTD only)</pb-link>). </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.9.14\">Similarly, in the parameterized RELAX NG schemas, every element is defined by a pattern\n          named after the element.

This allows users to rename elements by redefining the\n          appropriate parameter entity. Parameter entities used for this purpose are formed by\n          taking the standard generic identifier of the element and attaching the string\n            n. as a prefix. Thus the standard generic identifiers for paragraphs, notes,\n          and quotations, <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.11.6.4\" href=\"/ref/p\" target=\"\">p</a>, <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.11.6.6\" href=\"/ref/note\" target=\"\">note</a>, and <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.11.6.8\" href=\"/ref/persName\" target=\"\">persName</a> are defined by\n          declarations of the following form: <div class=\"tei-eg example\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.11.6.10\"><pb-code-highlight theme=\"solarizedlight\"><template>&lt;!ENTITY % n.p \"p\"&gt;\n&lt;!ENTITY % n.note \"note\"&gt; \n&lt;!ENTITY % n.persName \"persName\"&gt;</template></pb-code-highlight></div> Note that since all names are case-sensitive, the specific\n          mix of uppercase and lowercase letters in the standard generic identifier must be\n          preserved in the entity name. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.11.8\">These declarations are generated by an ODD processor when TEI DTD fragments are created. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.11.10\"> In the RELAX NG schemas, all elements are normally defined using a pattern with the same\n          name as the element (as described in <pb-link class=\"inner-ref\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.11.10.2\" emit=\"transcription\" hash=\"IM-naming\" xml-id=\"IM-naming\">23.5.3 Names and Documentation in Generated Schemas</pb-link>): for example\n          <div class=\"tei-eg example\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.11.10.4\"><pb-code-highlight theme=\"solarizedlight\"><template>abbr = element abbr { abbr.content, abbr.attributes }</template></pb-code-highlight></div> The easiest way of renaming the element is thus simply to rewrite the pattern with a\n          different element name; any references use the pattern, not the element, name.\n          <div class=\"tei-eg example\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.11.10.6\"><pb-code-highlight theme=\"solarizedlight\"><template>abbr = element abbrev { abbr.content, abbr.attributes }</template></pb-code-highlight></div> More complex revisions, such as redefining the content of the element (defined by the\n          pattern <span class=\"tei-ident2\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.11.10.8\">abbr.content</span>) or its attributes (defined by the pattern\n            <span class=\"tei-ident2\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.11.10.10\">abbr.attributes</span>) can be accomplished in a similar way, using\n          the features of the RELAX NG language.

Entity declarations must be made which\n          associate the names of these two files with the appropriate parameter entity so that the\n          declarations they contain can be embedded within the TEI DTD at an appropriate point.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.13.8\">The following entities are referred to by the main <span class=\"tei-ident2\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.13.8.2\">tei.dtd</span>\n          file to embed portions of the TEI DTD fragments or locally developed extensions. <dl class=\"tei-list3\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.13.8.4\"><dt data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.13.8.4.5\"><span class=\"tei-label\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.13.8.4.3\"><span class=\"tei-ident2\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.13.8.4.3.1\">TEI.extensions.ent</span></span></dt><dd data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.13.8.4.5\">identifies a local file containing extensions to the TEI parameter entities</dd><dt data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.13.8.4.9\"><span class=\"tei-label\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.13.8.4.7\"><span class=\"tei-ident2\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.13.8.4.7.1\">TEI.extensions.dtd</span></span></dt><dd data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.13.8.4.9\">identifies a local file containing extensions to the TEI module</dd></dl></p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.13.10\">For example, if the relevant files are called <span class=\"tei-ident2 noindex\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.13.10.2\">project.ent</span> and <span class=\"tei-ident2 noindex\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.13.10.4\">project.dtd</span>, then\n          declarations like the following would be appropriate: <div class=\"tei-eg example\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.13.10.6\"><pb-code-highlight theme=\"solarizedlight\"><template>&lt;!ENTITY % TEI.extensions.ent SYSTEM 'project.ent' &gt;\n&lt;!ENTITY % TEI.extensions.dtd SYSTEM 'project.dtd' &gt;</template></pb-code-highlight></div></p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.13.12\">When an entity is declared more than once, the first declaration is binding and the\n          others are ignored. The local modifications to parameter entities should therefore be\n          handled before the standard parameter entities themselves are declared in <span class=\"tei-ident2\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.13.12.2\">tei.dtd</span>. The entity <span class=\"tei-ident2\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.13.12.4\">TEI.extensions.ent</span> is\n          referred to before any TEI declarations are handled, to allow the user's declarations to\n          take priority. If the user does not provide a <span class=\"tei-ident2\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.13.12.6\">TEI.extensions.ent</span>\n          entity, the entity will be expanded to the empty string.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.13.14\">For example the encoder might wish to add two phrase-level elements <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.13.14.2\" href=\"/ref/it\" target=\"\">it</a> and <a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.13.14.4\" href=\"/ref/bd\" target=\"\">bd</a>, perhaps as synonyms for\n            hi rend='italics' and hi rend='bold'.

The content models of these new elements may also reference other\n          parameter entities, which is why they need to be declared after other declarations. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.13.18\">The second step involves modifying the element class to which the new elements should be\n          attached. This requires that the parameter entity <span class=\"tei-ident2\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.13.18.2\">macro.phraseSeq</span>\n          should be modified to include the generic identifiers for the new elements we wish to\n          create. The declaration for each modifiable parameter entity in the DTD includes a\n          reference to an additional parameter entity with the same name prefixed by an\n            <span class=\"tei-code2 code\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.13.18.4\">x.</span>; these entities are declared by default as the null string. However, in\n          the file containing local declarations they may be redeclared to include references to the\n          new class members: <div class=\"tei-eg example\" data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.30.13.18.6\"><pb-code-highlight theme=\"solarizedlight\"><template>&lt;!ENTITY % x.macro.phraseSeq 'it | bd\n|'&gt;</template></pb-code-highlight></div> and this declaration will take precedence over the default when the declaration for\n          macro.phraseSeq is evaluated. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section><div class=\"popovers\"></div></div>", "footnotes": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<div class=\"footnotes\"><dl class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn_1_7_4_46_16_22_14_6_24\"><dt class=\"fn-number\">1</dt><dd data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.14.6.24\" class=\"fn-content\">Excluding\n              <span data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.22.14.6.24.3\" class=\"tei-ident1\"><a href=\"ref/model.gLike\">model.gLike</a></span> is generally inadvisable however, since\n            without it the resulting schema has no way of referencing non-Unicode characters.<a class=\"fn-back\" href=\"#fnref_1_7_4_46_16_22_14_6_24\">↩</a></dd></dl><dl class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn_1_7_4_46_16_24_6_6\"><dt class=\"fn-number\">2</dt><dd data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.24.6.6\" class=\"fn-content\">This is not strictly the case,\n          since the element <a data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.24.6.6.3\" href=\"ref/egXML\" class=\"tei-gi\" target=\"\">egXML</a> used to represent TEI examples has its own namespace,\n            http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples; this is the only exception however. <a class=\"fn-back\" href=\"#fnref_1_7_4_46_16_24_6_6\">↩</a></dd></dl><dl class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn_1_7_4_46_16_24_14_4\"><dt class=\"fn-number\">3</dt><dd data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.24.14.4\" class=\"fn-content\">Full namespace support does not exist in\n          the DTD language, and therefore these techniques are available only to users of more\n          modern schema languages such as RELAX NG or W3C Schema.<a class=\"fn-back\" href=\"#fnref_1_7_4_46_16_24_14_4\">↩</a></dd></dl><dl class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn_1_7_4_46_16_26_6_12\"><dt class=\"fn-number\">4</dt><dd data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.16.26.6.12\" class=\"fn-content\">This module can be used to document any XML\n          schema, and has indeed been used to document several non-TEI schemas.<a class=\"fn-back\" href=\"#fnref_1_7_4_46_16_26_6_12\">↩</a></dd></dl><dl class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn_1_7_4_46_18_20_8_2\"><dt class=\"fn-number\">5</dt><dd data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.20.8.2\" class=\"fn-content\">Here and elsewhere we use the word <span data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.18.20.8.2.3\" class=\"tei-mentioned\">schema</span> to refer\n          to any formal document grammar language, irrespective of the formalism used to represent\n          it.<a class=\"fn-back\" href=\"#fnref_1_7_4_46_18_20_8_2\">↩</a></dd></dl><dl class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn_1_7_4_46_20_14_7_4_5_14\"><dt class=\"fn-number\">6</dt><dd data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.14.7.4.5.14\" class=\"fn-content\">An ODD processor should recognize as\n              erroneous such obvious inconsistencies as an attempt to include an\n                <a data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.14.7.4.5.14.3\" href=\"ref/elementSpec\" class=\"tei-gi\" target=\"\">elementSpec</a> in add mode for an element which is already present\n              in an imported module.<a class=\"fn-back\" href=\"#fnref_1_7_4_46_20_14_7_4_5_14\">↩</a></dd></dl><dl class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn_1_7_4_46_20_14_19_2\"><dt class=\"fn-number\">7</dt><dd data-tei=\"1.7.4.46.20.14.19.2\" class=\"fn-content\">The carthago program behind the\n          Pizza Chef application, written by Michael Sperberg-McQueen for TEI P3 and P4, went to\n          very great efforts to get this right.
