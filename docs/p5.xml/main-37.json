Although full backwards compatibility cannot be guaranteed,\n      we believe our implementation is consistent with that goal.\n      </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.6.8\">In most respects, the TEI Guidelines have stood the test of time remarkably\nwell. The present edition makes no substantial attempt to rewrite those few parts\nof them which have now been rendered obsolete by changes since their\nfirst publication, though an indication is given in the text of where such rewriting is\nnow considered necessary. Neither does the present version attempt to\naddress any of the many possible new areas of digital activity in which\nthe TEI approach to standardization may have something to offer. Both\nthese tasks require the existence of an informed and active TEI\nCouncil to direct and validate such extension and maintenance work,\nin response to the changing needs and priorities of the TEI user community. \n</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.6.10\">Two exceptions to the above principles may be cited: firstly, the\nchapter which originally provided a Gentle\nIntroduction to SGML has been completely rewritten to\nprovide a similarly gentle introduction to XML; secondly the chapter\non character sets has been completely revised in light of the\nclose connexion between Unicode and XML. The editors gratefully\nacknowledge the assistance of the <span class=\"tei-foreign\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.6.10.4\">ad hoc</span> workgroup chaired by Christian\nWittern, which undertook to provide expert advice and correction at\nvery short notice, in the latter task.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.6.12\">The preparation of this new version relied extensively on\npreliminary work carried out by the former North American editor of\nthe TEI Guidelines, C.M. Sperberg-McQueen. In a TEI working paper\nwritten in 1999<a class=\"note tei-note\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.6.12.2\" href=\"#fn_1_7_6_16_6_12_2\" id=\"fnref_1_7_6_16_6_12_2\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a> he sketched\nout a precise blueprint for the conversion of the TEI from SGML to\nXML, which we have implemented, with only slight modification.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.6.14\">The Editors would also like to express thanks to the\nteam of volunteers from the TEI community who helped us with the task\nof proofreading the first draft during the summer of 2001; and to \n      Sebastian Rahtz of Oxford University Computing Services, without\n      whose skill and enthusiasm this new edition would not have been\n      possible.\n</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.6.16\">A substantial proportion of the work of preparing this new edition was\nfunded with the assistance of a grant from the US National\nEndowment for the Humanities, whose continued support of the TEI has\nalso been crucial to the effort of setting up the TEI Consortium.\n</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.6.18\">Finally, we would like to thank all our colleagues on the interim\nmanagement board of the TEI Consortium, in particular its Chairman\nJohn Unsworth, for their continued support of\nthe TEI's work, and their willingness to devote effort to the\ndifficult task of overseeing its transition to a new organizational\ninfrastructure.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.6.20\">Summary details of the changes made in the present and previous\neditions are given in their Prefatory Notes, all of which are now\nreproduced in an Appendix to the present edition: see <pb-link class=\"inner-ref\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.6.20.2\" emit=\"transcription\" hash=\"PREFS\" xml-id=\"PREFS\">8 Prefatory Notes</pb-link>.\n</p>\n<span class=\"tei-signed2\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.6.22\">Lou Burnard and Syd Bauman (TEI Editors)<br class=\"tei-lb\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.6.22.2\"/>\nOxford and Providence, March 2002.</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tei-div10\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.8\" id=\"p4pf01\"><h2 class=\"tei-head9\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.8.2\">8.2 Introductory Note (November 2001)</h2>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.8.4\">To complete the work started in June of this year, the TEI Editors\nasked for volunteers from the TEI community to proofread the preliminary XML\nversion. 24 volunteers responded to this call during August, and gave invaluable help both by identifying\na number of previously un-noticed errors, and by suggesting areas in\nwhich more substantial revision should be undertaken in the\nfuture. The Editors gratefully acknowledge the assistance of the following\nindividuals during this exercise:\n</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p display\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.8.6\">\nJimmy Adair,\nSyd Bauman,\nMichael Beddow,\nSteven Bird,\nLisa Charlong, \nMatthew Driscoll,\nPatrick Durusau,\nTomaz Erjavec,\nNick Finke,\nTim Finney,\nJulia Flanders,\nMike Fraser,\nPankaj Kamthan,\nFrançois Lachance,\nTerry Langendoen,\nAnne Mahoney,\nGregory Murphy,\nDaniel Pitti,\nRafal Prinke,\nLaurent Romary,\nStewart Russell,\nGary Simons,\nElisabeth Solopova,\nChristian Wittern, \nMartin Wynne.\n</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.8.8\">In addition to error correction, and clear delineation of those sections in\nwhich substantial revision is yet to be undertaken for TEI P5, the\npresent draft differs from earlier ones in the following respects:\n<ul class=\"tei-list3 bulleted\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.8.8.2\"><li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.8.8.2.3\">Formal Public Identifiers have been introduced as a means of\nconstructing TEI DTDs and an SGML Open Catalog is now included with the\nstandard release; </li><li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.8.8.2.5\">Some systematic errors and omissions in the reference section\nhave been removed; the format of this  section  has been substantially changed, we\nhope for the better;</li><li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.8.8.2.7\">The chapters on obtaining the TEI DTDs and WSDs have been\nbrought up to date; the chapter on modification has been expanded to\ninclude a discussion of the TEI Lite customization;</li><li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.8.8.2.9\">All examples and cited markup has been checked for XML validity\nagainst the published DTDs, and corrected where faulty; examples have\nbeen formatted in a (more or less) consistent style.</li></ul>\n</p>\n<span class=\"tei-signed2\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.8.10\">Lou Burnard and Syd Bauman (Editors)<br class=\"tei-lb\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.8.10.2\"/>\nOxford and Providence, November 2001.</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tei-div10\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.10\" id=\"PPF2\"><h2 class=\"tei-head9\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.10.2\">8.3 Introductory Note (June 2001)</h2>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.10.4\">This is a preliminary version of a revised and fully XML-compliant\nedition of the TEI Guidelines. Although work on revising and\ncorrecting the text of the document is incomplete, by making\navailable this preliminary version we hope to facilitate testing of\nthe XML document type declarations which it describes by as wide a\nrange of TEI users as possible. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.10.6\">The primary goal of this revision is to make available the\ncorrected (May 1999) edition of the Guidelines in a new version which:\n<ul class=\"tei-list3 bulleted\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.10.6.2\"><li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.10.6.2.3\">is expressed  in XML and itself conforms to a TEI-conformant XML\n       DTD;</li><li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.10.6.2.5\">generates a set of XML DTD fragments that can be combined\n       together in the same way as the existing TEI (P3) SGML DTD\n       fragments to form true TEI XML DTD fragments without loss of functionality;</li><li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.10.6.2.7\">can be processed and maintained using readily available XML\n       tools instead of the special-purpose ad hoc software originally\n       used for TEI P3.</li></ul>\nAs noted elsewhere, a number of errors were corrected in\nthe May 1999 edition. A (much) smaller number of errors have also been\ncorrected in this edition, but no new material has been added. We\nexpect the expansion and modification of the Guidelines to become\na real possibility in the context of the newly formed TEI Consortium,\nwhich has funded the preparation of this present edition.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.10.8\">A major design goal of both this and the previous revision has been\n      to ensure that the DTD fragments generated would not break\n      existing documents: in other words, that any document conforming\n      to the original TEI P3 SGML DTD would also conform to the new\n      XML version of it. Although full backwards compatibility cannot\n     be guaranteed, we believe our implementation is consistent with\n      that goal.  </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.10.10\">In making this new version, we relied extensively on preliminary\n      work carried out by the outgoing North American editor of the\n      TEI Guidelines, Michael Sperberg-McQueen. In a TEI working paper\n      written in 1999, TEI ED\n      W69, Michael sketched out a precise blueprint for the\n      conversion of the TEI from SGML to XML, which we have\n      implemented, with only slight modification. The current TEI\n      editors wish to express here our admiration for the detailed\n      care put into that paper, without which our task would have been\n      forbiddingly difficult, if not impossible. We would also like to\n      express our thanks to Sebastian Rahtz of Oxford University\n      Computing Services, for his invaluable assistance in preparing\n      this new edition.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.10.12\">We list here in summary form all the changes made in the present\nedition. Full technical details are provided in documents TEI EDW69\nand TEI EDW70, available from the TEI web site. \n<ol class=\"tei-list1 numbered\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.10.12.2\">\n<li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.10.12.2.3\">A new keyword <span class=\"tei-ident2\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.10.12.2.3.2\">TEI.XML</span> has been added. By setting\nits value to INCLUDE, rather than the default IGNORE,\nthe user can request generation of an XML rather than an SGML DTD;</li>\n<li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.10.12.2.5\">The content models of all elements have been checked, and, where\nnecessary, changed so that they are equally valid as SGML or as\nXML; </li>\n<li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.10.12.2.7\">The declared value for all attributes has been changed to a form\nwhich is equally valid as SGML or as XML;</li>\n<li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.10.12.2.9\">All the examples have been checked for conformance and converted to\nuse XML syntax, where possible. (This process is currently incomplete.)</li>\n<li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.10.12.2.11\">Some errors and duplications in the class\nmembership of elements from the names and dates tagsets have been corrected. </li></ol></p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.10.14\">To implement the first of these, we have parameterized the\n<span class=\"tei-term\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.10.14.2\">tag omissibility</span> indicators <span class=\"tei-q2\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.10.14.4\">- o</span> and <span class=\"tei-q2\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.10.14.6\">- -</span>\nused within element declarations in the DTD. When XML is to be\ngenerated, the parameter entities concerned are redeclared with the null\nstring as their value. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.10.16\">The second change was achieved by removing SGML-specific features\n(ampersand connectors, inclusion and exclusion exceptions, various\ntypes of attribute content) from the DTD and revising the syntax of\nthe DTD to conform to XML requirements (specifically in the\nrepresentation of mixed-content models, and by removing redundant\nparentheses). In making these changes, we took care to ensure that the\nresulting content model would continue to accept existing valid\ndocuments, though in the nature of things it could not be guaranteed\nto reject the same set of documents. As further discussed in EDW69 and\nEDW70, some constraints (exclusion exceptions, for example) which\ncould be carried out by a generic SGML parser using TEI P3 will have\nto be implemented by a special purpose TEI validator using TEI\nP4. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.10.18\">Much work remains to be done, firstly in testing the new DTD\nfragments against as wide a range of TEI materials as possible,\nsecondly in revising the discussion of markup theory and practice\nwithin the text to reflect current thinking. A few sections of the\ncurrent text (the Gentle Introduction to SGML and the discussion of\nExtended Pointer syntax are two examples) will need substantial\nrewriting. For the most part, however, we think the Guidelines have\nstood the test of time well and can be recommended to a new generation of\ntext encoders scarcely born at the time they were first formulated.\n</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.10.20\">Lou Burnard and Steve De Rose (Editors)</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.10.22\">Oxford and Providence, May 2001.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tei-div10\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.12\" id=\"ppf\">\n<h2 class=\"tei-head9\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.12.3\">8.4 Introductory Note (May 1999)</h2>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.12.5\">No work of the size and complexity of the TEI\n<span class=\"tei-title5\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.12.5.2\">Guidelines</span> could reasonably be expected to be error-free on\npublication, nor to remain long uncorrected. It has however taken rather longer\nthan might have been anticipated to complete production of the present\ncorrected reprint of the first edition, for which we present our apologies,\nboth to the many individuals and institutions whose enthusiastic adoption and\npromotion of the TEI encoding scheme have ensured its continued survival in the\nrapidly changing world of digital scholarship, and also to the many helpfully\ncritical users whose assiduous uncovering and reporting of our errors have made\npossible the present revision. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.12.7\">At its first meeting in Bergen, in June 1996, the TEI Technical Review\nCommittee (TRC) approved the setting up of a small working committee to oversee the\nproduction of a revised edition of the TEI\n<span class=\"tei-title5\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.12.7.2\">Guidelines</span>, to include corrections of as many as possible of the\n`corrigible errors' notified to the editors since publication\nof the first edition in May 1994, the bulk of which are summarized in a TEI\nworking paper (TEI EDW67, available from the TEI web site). </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.12.9\">During the spring of 1997, this TRC Core Subcommittee reviewed nearly 200\ncomments and proposals which the editors had collected from public debate and\ndiscussion over the preceding two years, and provided invaluable technical\nguidance in disposition of them. We are glad to take this opportunity of\nexpressing our thanks to this subcommittee, whose members were Elli Mylonas,\nDominic Dunlop, and David T. Barnard. </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.12.11\">The work of making the corrections and regenerating the text proceeded\n  rather fitfully during 1998 and 1999, largely because of increasing demands on\n  the editors' time from their other responsibilities. With the\n  establishment of the new TEI Consortium, it is be hoped that maintenance of the\n  Guidelines will be placed on a more secure footing. Some specific areas in which we\n  anticipate future revisions being carried out are listed below. </p>\n<div class=\"tei-div10\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.12.13\" id=\"ppf-tcm\">\n<h3 class=\"tei-head9\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.12.13.3\">8.4.1 Typographic Corrections Made</h3>\n<ul class=\"tei-list3 bulleted\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.12.13.5\"><li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.12.13.5.3\">examples of TEI markup throughout the text were all checked against the\n\t relevant DTD fragment and an embarassingly large number of tagging errors\n\t corrected;</li><li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.12.13.5.5\">various minor typographic and spelling errors were corrected;</li><li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.12.13.5.7\">the corrigible errors listed in working paper TEI EDW67 were all\n\t corrected: some of these required specific changes to the DTD which are listed\n\t in the next section.</li></ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tei-div10\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.12.15\" id=\"ppf-spc\">\n<h3 class=\"tei-head9\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.12.15.3\">8.4.2 Specific Changes in the DTD</h3>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.12.15.5\">A major goal of this revision was to avoid changes which might invalidate\n  existing data, even where existing constructs seemed erroneous in retrospect.\n  To that end, wherever changes have been made in content models for existing\n  elements, they have as far as possible been made so that the DTD will now\n  accept a superset of what was previously legal. Only one new element\n  (<a class=\"tei-gi\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.12.15.5.2\" href=\"/ref/ab\" target=\"\">ab</a>) has been added.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.12.15.7\">Where possible, a few content models have been changed in such a way as to\n  facilitate conversion to XML, but XML compatibility is\n  not a goal\n  of this revision.</p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.12.15.9\">Brief details of all changes made in the DTD follow:\n<ul class=\"tei-list3 bulleted\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.12.15.9.2\"><li class=\"tei-item\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.12.15.9.2.3\">Several changes were made in class membership, in order to correct\n\t unreachability problems.

It soon became apparent that a sufficiently flexible\nscheme could provide solutions for text encoding problems generally. The\nscope of the TEI was therefore broadened to meet the varied encoding\nrequirements of any discipline or application. Thus, the TEI became the\nonly systematized attempt to develop a fully general text encoding model\nand set of encoding conventions based upon it, suitable for processing\nand analysis of any type of text, in any language, and intended to serve\nthe increasing range of existing (and potential) applications and use.\n </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.14.8\">What is published here is a major milestone in this effort. It\nprovides a single, coherent framework for all kinds of text encoding\nwhich is hardware-, software- and application-independent. Within this\nframework, it specifies encoding conventions for a number of key text\ntypes and features. The ongoing work of the TEI is to extend the\nscheme presented here to cover additional text types and features, as\nwell as to continue to refine its encoding recommendations on the\nbasis of extensive experience with their actual application and use.\n </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.14.10\">We therefore offer these Guidelines to the user community for use in\nthe same spirit of active collaboration and cooperation with which\nthey have so far been developed. The TEI is committed to actively\nsupporting the wide-spread and large-scale use of the Guidelines\nwhich, with the publication of this volume, is now for the first time\npossible. In addition, we anticipate that users of the TEI Guidelines\nwill in some instances adapt and extend them as necessary to suit\nparticular needs; we invite such users to engage in the further\ndevelopment of these Guidelines by working with us as they do so.\n </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.14.12\">Like any standard which is actually used, these Guidelines do not\nrepresent a static finished work, but rather one which will evolve\nover time with the active involvement of its community of users. We\ninvite and encourage the participation of the user community in\nthis process, in order to ensure that the TEI Guidelines become and\nremain useful in all sorts of work with machine-readable texts.\n </p>\n<p class=\"tei-p\" data-tei=\"1.7.6.16.14.14\">This document was made possible in part by financial support from\nthe U.S. National Endowment for the Humanities, an independent federal\nagency; Directorate General XIII of the Commission of the European\nCommunities; the Andrew W.

Direct and indirect\nsupport has also been received from the University of Illinois at\nChicago, the Oxford University Computing Services, the University of\nArizona, the University of Oslo and Queen's University (Kingston,\nOnt.), Bellcore (Bell Communications Research), the Istituto di\nLinguistica Computazionale (C.N.R.)
